## Philosophy

The name **Blue PSL 10K** is a playful nod to:

- **PSL** – Pumpkin Spice Latte (Catppuccin's coffee-inspired naming) and *Posh Segment Latte* (Oh-My-Posh + prompt segments + Latte base)
- **10K** – The legendary PowerLevel10K prompt, whose styling inspired this theme's prompt layout
- **Blue** – The custom `#3465a4` path/directory color that unifies the look across terminals and editors
